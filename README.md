# ProxyStorm
ProxyStorm is a proxy scraper built with Python. It is currently under production and is (kindof) not working yet.

## Why did I make this?
ProxyStorm is made for people who want a lot of proxies. I made this beacuse I saw a lot of people on cracking forums needed a lot of high quality proxies, so I kindof just figured I should make a program that does this
